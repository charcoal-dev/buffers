# Charcoal Buffers

Buffers is a library designed for the intricate handling of byte arrays. Within its suite of tools, you'll find
capabilities that not only simplify the generation of cryptographic hashes and seamless byte array reading but also
provide robust solutions for fixed-sized buffer frames and variable length buffers. Furthermore, understanding the
significance of byte order, our library offers comprehensive support for both little-endian and big-endian
configurations, ensuring optimal adaptability and interoperability across diverse platforms and systems. Crafted with
precision and emphasizing user experience, this library offers an unparalleled bridge between complexity and usability
in the byte array manipulation arena.
